### What do we mean when we say “class” in natural language? 
This is really a class, a tutorial, about subclasses; but, you can’t talk about subclasses without talking about classes. So it’s really a class and subclass class. 

The word “class” can be used in different ways, it could be a course of instruction, a social rank, or the quality of someone elegant – “Tony Bennett has a lot of class.” But you probably aren’t concerned here about your social rank, although it will, no doubt, rise as a result of this class. You inherently have the attribute of panache; so, perhaps this is the classy class and subclass class.
