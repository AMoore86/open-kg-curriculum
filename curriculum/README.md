## Learning Objectives and Paths
Learning Objectives are statements that have the form: "I am a `part of audience`, and I want to know `a learning objective`." For example, "I am best described as a _practitioner_ and I want to _learn what a knowledge graph schema is_." Learning Paths are the sequence of modules that a learner would review in order to accomplish their learning objective.

Here are some example learning paths:
* [All Learning Paths](./learning_paths.md)
* "I am a practitioner and I want to learn what a knowledge graph schema is."
* "I am a beginner and I want to deploy a knowledge graph."
* "I am a graduate student and I need to survey different ontology engineering paradigms."
* "I am a project manager and I am exploring knowledge graph technologies, where do I start?"
